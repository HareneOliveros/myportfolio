<h4 style="background-color:red color:white;"> ABOUT ME</h4>
<p1 style="background-color:powderblue;"> I'm Harene A. Oliveros, 21 years old from the Municipality of San Francisco. I was born on May 23, 2001. I'm fond of singing, dancing, and listening to music. I am currently taking up Bachelor of Industrial Technology - Major in Computer Technology in Cebu Technological University - San Francisco Campus.I have 6 sibling, 4 sisters, and 2 brothers. I am the third daughter of my family.
<h5 style="background-color:pink;"> My motto in my life Always remember to fall asleep with a dream and wake up with a purpose, You just have to have the drive and purpose to make it happen. You have to be willing to hustle, to keep going, to never stop fighting. Unfortunately, you may even fail, but it will never be because you didn't try hard enough. Put some purpose and drive behind last night's dreams.
</h1 style="background-color:maroon;"> My plan after graduating, I find a job to help my parents so that I can repay their hard work that they gave us just to succeed in school. More hard work,more success ,so my inspiration to my studies is my parents.
